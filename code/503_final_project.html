            not only detriment our own health: mental disorder and mortality,
            but also bring serious impact to society: traffic accidents and

        <p>The leaflet plot above shows distribution of three types of alcohol
          drinker in 2010. As we could see, drinking is so prevalent in well
          developed countries especially those; in Western Europe and North
          America, and this finding leads to the analysis of relationship
          between alcohol consumption and GDP per capita which plotted below. We
          could see, in 2010, almost 95 percents of adults had drunk alcohol in
          previous year. Also, heavy drinking is defined as the proportion of
          adult drinkers (aged 15 and older) who have had at least 60 grams or
          more of pure alcohol on at least one occasion in the past 30 days. The
          heavy drinking distribution is a lot different than regular drinking
          distribution plot. We see that Mongolia and Madagascar have large
          difference in percentage of population between situations of regular
          drinking and heavy drinking. Also Russia, Canada and U.S.A have high
          percentage of population in regular drinking situation but low
          percentage of population in heavy drinking situation, which probably
          indicate that some of their residents drink just for engagement or
          getting warm. The plot of distribution of non-alcohol drinker shows
          that most Asia and Africa countries have high percentage of population
          that never drink alcohol in past whole year, which from assumption
          could due to poverty or taboo.</p>
        <p>The plot below provides a illustration of top 10 countries with
          highest total alcohol consumption per capita, and we could see that
          most of them are in Eastern Europe.</p>

          <p>The R shiny app above describes the relationship between GDP per
            capita (dollar) and alcohol consumption per person (litres). By
            comparison, we see that at same level of GDP, residents in the
            Middle East countries have significantly lower alcohol consumption
            than those residents in Europe or North America, which probably due
            to the cultural restriction on alcohol intake. However, when we
            lower the maximum GDP threshold, we see some Asia countries and
            Africa countries appear and they have much lower alcohol consumption
            than those country in Europe, which prove our assumption above that
            culture and poverty do play an important role in limiting alcohol
            consumption for residents in those countries. After having a general
            sense of worldwide alcohol consumption situation, lets' take a
            closer look at consumption situation for three major alcohol types:
            beer, wine and spirits. </p>

          <p> The plot above I compare the recent 50 years of consumption
            situation of three major alcohol beverages in four countries: China,
            Germany Japan and United States which has different drinking culture
            and alcohol preference. We could see that the demand of beer is much
            more higher than wine and spirits for all four countries especially
            in Germany which is famous for its black beer. Also, there is
            obvious difference in wine consumption between those Western
            countries and Asian countries, which probably due to different
            drinking culture. Besides, we could see there is an interesting U
            shaped curve on consumption of spirits in China, which probably due
            to fact that there might be regulation on spirits between year 2000
            and 2008</p>
          <p> Then we take a closer look alcohol consumption per person in U.S.
            We could see that the consumption of three types of alcohol of three
            alcohols are pretty average over years except over the period 1920
            to 1933 where there was a ban on the production, importation,
            transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages in U.S which was
            known as the 'National Alcohol Prohibition'.</p>

          <p> Furthermore, we examined the total alcohol expenditure in U.S
            differentiated by sources drank at home and away from home from year
            1935 to year 2014. We could see that though restaurants and bars are
            still the main seller of alcohol in U.S due to both entertainment
            and business purpose, more people start to purchase alcohol from
            store and drink at home, which indicate the shift of occasion of
            drinking.</p>

          <p> There is both direct and indirect relationship between alcohol and
            deaths. Indirect deaths from alcohol use disorders can occur
            indirectly through suicide. The network plot depicts the linkage
            between alcohol use, mental disorders and suicide, the shorter the

          <p> Also there is evidence suggest that people with mental disorder

            shows risks of having alcohol dependency for people with different
            types of mental disorder. We could see that people with intermittent
            explosive disorder, dysthymia, ODD, bipolar disorder and social
            phobia are at lease 3 times as likely to develop alcohol dependency
            relatively to those without. </p>

          <p> Alcohol use disorder is defined by the International
            Classification of Diseases as the presence of three or more
            indicators of dependence for at lease a month within the previous
            year. There is causal relationship between alcohol use disorder and
            deaths (not include suicide), and we could see that in 2016, Russia
            had the highest death rate, around 17 people per 100,000 individuals
            die from alcohol use disorder. From the lineplot, we see that in
            worldwide, the death rate from alcohol use disorder is gradually
            decreasing over years with the rate around 2.37 per 100,000 people
            die in 2016. </p>
          <p> Moreover, driving after drinking alcohol has high risk of getting
            traffic accident and even causing deaths. From data reported in
            2013, we see that North America countries: United States and Canada
            are the top two countries with 32.2 percent of road traffic deaths
            cases attributed to alcohol; and to decrease that value, government
            in both countries enacted strict law about driving under influence,
            and we will check that value again once we get newest dataset. </p>
          <p> Besides, after heavy drinking of alcohol people could easily lost
            their mind and thus have high chance of commiting crimes. In the
            worldmap of percentage of crimes related to alcohol, we see that
            countries in Eastern Europe have significant higher portion of
            crimes related to alcohol, and also from previous plot we also know
            those countries have high alcohol consumption per person each year,
            thus for those countries with high crime rates related to alcohol
            limiting amount of alcohol sell per person might reduce crime rates
            and stabilize social order. </p>

          <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
          <p> Historically, alcohol is important on occasion of entertainment
            and business, however we should always remember that we have limit
            on how much we could drink and also how drinking impair our personal
            health. Nationwide, there should be a law that limit how much
            alcohol drink each person can purchase and drink to reduce rates of
            alcohol related disorders, traffic accidents and crimes. Finally let
            me referred a sentence that I excerpted online " I take
            pride in the fact that I can handle uncomfortable mental states
            without running to the liquor store (be they anger, lonliness,
            melancholy, anxiety) and it is wonderful to know that I am HELPING
            MYSELF IN A BIG WAY, because alcohol only makes these moods worse
            (later)." </p>

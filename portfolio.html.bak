What have changed to popular songs </h3>        <!--- Network Model--->        <p> Our team studies the trend for the development of popular music          throughout the years, we chose several factors to investigate in. Let          us first look at an overview of the most popular bigrams used in          lyrics, visualized using a network. </p>        <div> </div>        <p> Now, we know that the lyrics are longer, but is the lexical          diversity lower or higher? Lexical diversity is the percentage of          distinct words over the total number of words, lower lexical diversity          means the lyrics are simpler. </p>        <!--- Line plot change of lexical diversity--->        <div class="iframePlaceholder" id="124" stype="position: relative"> </div>        <p> From the plot, we can see that there is an obvious decrease in          lexical diversity throughout the years. Combining with the fact that          lyrics are getting longer, there are actually fewer unique words in          the popular songs. </p>        <p> Finally, Let us look at one more interesting statistics, the average          length of song names. </p>        <!--- line plot average length of song names--->        <div class="iframePlaceholder" id="125" stype="position: relative"> </div>        <p> Not only the word choices are simpler, the titles are also getting          shorter and simpler. A quick conclusion we can make is that the even          though the length of popular songs are getting longer, the contents          are getting less complicated and simpler. </p>        <h2 id="part3">Part 3</h2>        <h3> 3. What is the change of sentiments in lyrics </h3>        <p> In this section, the team uses the sentimental analysis method to          study the trend of lyrics in popular music. In the first part of this          project, the songs of Taylor Swift were used as an example. The team          includes all songs in the Billboard over last 10 years. The lyrics are          first to split to lines and each line with words which represent          certain sentiment will be classified and included in our research. All          lines in lyrics without any words for moods are neglected. </p>        <p> Same as the Taylor Swift example, all the lyrics are classified into          8 categories: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness,          surprise, and trust. And these sentiments could be furtherly          classified into two categories: positive and negative. </p>        <div class="row"> <img src="8sentiment_bar.png" alt="barchart of 8 major sentiment count  "            title="eight major sentiment count"            style="width:100%">        </div>        <p> The plot above shows the percentage of the numbers of lines with          certain sentiment over the total amount of lines in the songs.          According to the plot, we can find that there are more positive songs          in the last 10 years and the most frequent sentiment in lyrics is the          joy. </p>        <div class="row"> <img src="sentiment_year.png" alt="Line plot for change of Sentiment change over Years  "            title="change of sentiment over year"            style="width:100%">        </div>        <p> Then, let us have a look at the change of the sentiments over time.          The team firstly treat each song as a whole and find the dominant          sentiment (positive or negative) in the song. The sentiment score          means the number of positive songs or negative songs. With the graph,          we can find that there are generally more positive songs in the last          10 years. However, there is a clear increase in negative songs. </p>        <div class="row"> <img src="sentiment_change_year.png" alt="Line plot for Sentiment change over Years  "            title="Change of Detailed Sentiments over Years"            style="width:100%">        </div>        <p> The team also use detailed sentiments to study the trend. Here, all          the sentences in the lyrics are counted separately and the sentiment          score means the total amount of lines with a certain sentiment over a          year. In the graph, only 4 sentiments with significant changes over          years are included. It is clear that Joy sentiment is most frequent.          However, there is an increase in the proportion of those Angry lyrics.          Sadness mood is surprisingly uncommon in songs. In general, this part          of the study shows that there are more negative songs recently,          especially angry songs, and the team wants to further study the          relationship between the sentiments in songs and the attitudes in          those Twitters related to the songs. </p>        <h2 id="part4">Part 4</h2>        <div> </div>        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>        <div> </div>      </div>    </div>  </body></html>
